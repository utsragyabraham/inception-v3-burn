# InceptionV3 - Burn
This project provides an implementation for the InceptionV3 as described in the [Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) paper.

The implementation is almost a one-to-one translation of the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) [implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/inception.py) (also see the [hub page](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_inception_v3/)).

Pre-trained weights for this model can be either downloaded from PyTorch (using torchvision), or from [mseitzer/pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid).
